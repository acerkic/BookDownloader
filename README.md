# BookDownlader

So I got tired of checking each book manually from

Scott H. Posted a link and unfortunatley there was nothing for just get all 400 + books.  

This was build with c# in VS 2015. The solution file may not open in anyting older, I don't know. 

If you run into issues feel free to create a bug.  This was a just a quick downloader for these books, I'll fix as I run across stuff.

Thanks
