# BookDownlader

So many free books from

but no zip or download all funciton. Book Downloader does just that.  


This was build with c# in VS 2015 as a console application. The solution file may not open in anyting older, 

If you run into issues feel free to create a bug.  This was a just a quick downloader for these books, I'll fix as I run across stuff.  

Also you can totally use bash with wget but where is the fun in that? (don't answer)

Thanks
